# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

1. **JavaScript basic statements**
The syntax for JavaScript is the most basic component for this language. This topic is only scraping the surface, therefore it is fairly easy to understand. Processes like getting user inputted values or generating outputs are easy to pick up.

2.  **Conditional statements**
Conditional statements are fairly easy for me especially because of the previous experience with C++. The conditional statements for JavaScript are really similar to the ones in C++. The only difference is having extra operators and different syntax for js.

3. **While, do while, for loops**
This topic also has been discussed for C++ in the previous grade, and so I atleast have experience on how to work with it, even in a different language. There is just different syntax and conditions, as well as how to discontinue them.

4. **Logical Operators**
The operators for JavaScript are also similar to the previous language that I have worked on.For me, It is easy to understand how each operator works, even the new operators that show the comparison of two values.

5. **Declaring functions**
I also have prior experience when working with functions because of C++. The functions have similar declaration, but there are different methods for JavaScript that can be used. There are also in built functions and custom functions.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **GitHub and VSCode setup**
I had trouble setting up GitHub, because it was a foreign application to me and I had no prior experience with it. The same went for VSCode, where I had to connect the repository from GitHub to VSCode after setting it up, which really confused me and took me quite some time to understand.

2. **JavaScript Syntax**
I had trouble understanding the basic JavaScript syntax, especially when I first started JavaScript. The components such as ` <html> `, ` <body> `, and `<script> `, really confused me about which went first for my code. The other components were fairly easy, such as the naming convention for variables.

3. **Number Objects**
For me, this was really troubling because of the many different properties to remember. Also the many different methods made it quite difficult for me to remember and keep up with all of it. 

4. **Nested Loops, break, continue**
I had trouble with this because of the difference between break and continue which sometimes confused me about which one I need to use for my code, like how break exists the loop immediately, and continue skips an iteration for the code because of a specific condition. And because of this, I often have trouble with nested loops, because it leads to some troubles where the loops doesn't run at all.

5. **Event Handlers**
We really did not discuss event handlers yet, which is why I am having trouble with it. I do not understand how to use onclick and onload yet for my codes, which is why I need to practice it for the future.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
I plan to answer more practice exercises on the given topics through the internet or with the help of AI. Like for nested loops, I can look for online coding exercises including nested loops. I plan to do the same thing for Number objects and event handlers which I also have trouble on. For the javascript syntax, I just need to memorize which goes first in order to get my code to work. 


# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
In our classes, I find the Non-Graded Exercises that you give us really helpful, because it lets us code without pressure of not getting the code right and failing. It gives us more space and allows us to test our knowledge better. I also find the speed tests helpful to test our skills on that specific topic before we do the graded exercise. So far, I do not find any activites in our class that aren't helpful for me.
